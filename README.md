## "Get nailed" : our submission for HACKXPLORE 2019

1. User uploads picture of their hand
2. If there's a hand in the picture, Hand Tracker will approve the user picture
3. detect_color files will use diseased nails RGB values --> extract those RGB values and create an image
4. From output image -> count number of coloured pixels
5. Coloured pixels / # of total pixels -> resulting % is used to 'diagnose'
6. If diagnosed, refers to a list of nearby doctors
